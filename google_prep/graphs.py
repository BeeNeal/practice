# There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers,
#  matrix, and adjacency list), and you should familiarize yourself with each 
# representation and its pros and cons.

# You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and 
# depth-first search. You should know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs,
#  and how to implement them in real code.


# NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem

# one of the easiest ways to implement a graph is with a 2D matrix
    # but not a good way to store sparse data

# Good way to store sparse data is with an adjacency list
